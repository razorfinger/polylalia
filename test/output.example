One morning, when mr gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that the bed had become a monstrous verminous bug. He lay on his armour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his brown, arched abdomen divided into rigid bow-like sections. From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide off completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous legs, pitifully thin compared with the rest of his circumference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.

"What happened to me,' he thought. It was not a dream. His room, the right place man, just a little too small, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. In the above table, from which it has expanded to a collection of sample cloth goods was spread (Samsa was a travelling salesman) hung the picture which he had cut out of an illustrated magazine a little while ago and is set in a pretty gilt frame. It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and fur boa. She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the viewer a solid fur muff which her entire forearm disappeared.
